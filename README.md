# 🚀 How to Work

Welcome aboard! Follow these simple steps to keep the workflow smooth and clean:  

1. 🔀 **Switch to your branch** — make sure you’re working in your own space  
2. 🔄 **Fetch origin** or **pull the latest changes** from the `develop` branch to stay updated  
3. ⚔️ **Resolve any merge conflicts** carefully if they pop up (they happen!)  
4. 🛠️ **Start coding** — add features, fix bugs, or improve docs on your branch

# 📤 How to Push

When your work is ready to shine, here’s what to do next:  

1. ✅ **Commit your changes** with a meaningful message describing what you did (be proud, but concise!)  
2. 🔼 **Push your branch** to the remote repository  
3. 🌐 **Open a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub:
   - From **your branch** → to the `develop` branch  
   - Add **Rizwan Ansar** as the reviewer 👤 (He’s got the magic touch 🪄)  
4. 🧘‍♂️ **Relax!** Rizwan will review, give feedback if needed, and merge your PR
